Insulin resistance
--------------------------------------------------------
When food is eaten the body converts the food into dietary sugars

Insulin is released by the pancreas to unlock cells to sugars and convert them to energy

Insulin resistance prevents cells from reacting to released Insulin

sugar is then built up in the blood

The pancreas reacts by releasing more insulin into the bloodstream.

The pancreas then becomes depleted of insulin and cannot produce it.

Blood sugars increase to diabetic levels.

Fasting
--------------------------------------------------------
body becomes more effient at using fats

residual glucose is released form muscles and liver to the brain

cells aren't as able to accept released glucose during fats

glucose levels elevate because cells become insulin resistant

- Hyperinsulinemia (elevated blood/insulin) - Hyperglycemia (elevated blood/sugar)
