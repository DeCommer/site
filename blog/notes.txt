Insulin converts carbs to fat

the brain can funciton without the intake of glucose/carbs



Insulin resistance
--------------------------------------------------------
    When food is eaten the body converts the food into dietary sugars

    Insulin is released by the pancreas to unlock cells to sugars and convert them to energy

    Insulin resistance prevents cells from reacting to released Insulin

    sugar is then built up in the blood

    The pancreas reacts by releasing more insulin into the bloodstream.

    The pancreas then becomes depleted of insulin and cannot produce it.

    Blood sugars increase to diabetic levels.

    Some causes - Being fat, Hyperinsulinemia, inflammation(immunoresponse), low muscle mass,
    lack of sleep, stress, menopause   

Fasting
--------------------------------------------------------
    Body becomes more effient at using fats

    Residual glucose is released form muscles and liver to the brain

    Cells aren't as able to accept released glucose during fats

    Glucose levels elevate because cells become insulin resistant

    - Hyperinsulinemia (elevated blood/insulin) - Hyperglycemia (elevated blood/sugar)

    Glucose is burned in the first 8 - 12 hours of fasting

    Tyglycerides(fat) turn into keytones and ketone bodies are used as energy
    
    Leads to autophagy - old cells die and new cells are generated (clean up)

    Side effect subside after 2 - 4 weeks

    Only weight train 2 hours after eating - not during fast.
    But weight training can deplete energy stores and promote faster autophagy
